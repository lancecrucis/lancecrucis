# 👓 Lance Christian C. Crucis


Hello there👋, I'm Lance, a Computer Science student at Cavite State University.

I’m a focused fool at heart, not afraid to dive into concepts I don’t fully understand yet. If there’s something I don’t know, I don’t avoid it. I break it down, study it, and work on it until I truly understand it. I believe mastery comes from curiosity, consistent effort, and the courage to struggle through complexity.
